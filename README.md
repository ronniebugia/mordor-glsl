# mordor-glsl
Three.js and GLSL rendering of the tower of Barad Dur in Mordor from The Lord of The Rings.

## About this Repository

Some of this code was originally part of a computer graphics course specifically the HTML code and Three.js camera controls. 
However, the GLSL shaders and most of the JavaScript are written by me. The tower of Mordor 3d model comes from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2434288.
